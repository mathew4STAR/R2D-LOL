R2D-LOL--> Stands for "RickRoll Detector - Laughing out Loud" (Yes, this lol is that lol, lol(Sorry))

The program is a joke, made for fun. Its purpose is to detect RickRolls given a youtube link.

Detection 1:
It first detects based on youtube detection (Youtube itself detects the song and puts it in description as "Never Gonna Give You Up (7" Mix)" by just checking this we can pretty much confirm whether it is a rickroll

Detection 2:
But in case this fails I will also try to implement my own algorithm to compare the audio it will probably work in a very simalar way to video but curtailed particularly towards never gonna give you up.
