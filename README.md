R2D-LOL--> Stands for "RickRoll Detector - Laughing out Loud" (Yes, this lol is that lol, lol)

The program is a joke made for fun. Its purpose is to detect RickRolls given a youtube link.

It runs multiple detections.
- Checks the description to check if youtube itself has detected it(this itself detects most rickrolls)
-- Plan to also implement a program which downloads the video and compares its audio with the orginal audio
-- Also as a last resort run a face detection program to detect Rick Astleys face
